# HTML Table Splitter

There may be multiple tables contained by a single html page downloaded by out downloader. `table_splitter` is used to split tables into separate htm files.

By looking through some sample html files, I find a regular pattern that tables have two layer structure with the outer layer tag describe its unique id, such as 
```
<table class="report" border="0" cellspacing="2" id="idp6812129776">
```
and the inner layer contains the detail about the table's content such as 
```
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="font: 11pt Calibri, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse">
```
My method is finding the table object with no id attribute, and wrapping it with html headers.

------
The code provide two functions: 

1. ```table_extractor(html_text)``` takes in the text of html file and return the list of beautifulsoup objects of tables.

2. ```package(html_file,tables)``` takes in the table list generated by `table_extractor(html_text)` and save them into a folder with the same name as the html_file. If you want to work on the beautifulsoup objects directly, there is no need to use this function.
